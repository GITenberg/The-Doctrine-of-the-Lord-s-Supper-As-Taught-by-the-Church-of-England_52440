<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a very easy thing to make a
confident assertion, and such assertions produce a greater effect
on many minds than the most careful and best-established
proof.&nbsp; Thus it is not at all an uncommon thing to hear it
asserted with the utmost confidence that what is termed
&lsquo;The Doctrine of the Real Presence,&rsquo; is taught by the
Church of England; and the result is that a considerable number
of persons believe in the assertion, and place reliance on those
who make it, as if they, and they only, were the true expositors
of the Church&rsquo;s doctrine.&nbsp; In many cases a blind
consent is blindly given.&nbsp; The Scriptures are not
investigated because the <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>point is supposed to have been settled
by the Church, and the documents of the Church are not studied
because the doctrine is regarded as beyond the reach of doubt;
whereas, if the real groundwork of that opinion were examined, it
would be found to consist in nothing more than confident
assertion.&nbsp; But those who are loyal to the Church of England
ought not to be satisfied with any such representation of its
teaching.&nbsp; The issues at stake are far too serious, and, now
that after three hundred years of faithful service the Church of
England is entering on such a sifting time as she has never yet
experienced, it is only fair to her that her own language should
be patiently heard, and her own teaching honestly examined.&nbsp;
This, then, is the object of this address.&nbsp; I am not about
to discuss the teaching of Scripture, but of the Church of
England; and my desire is to ascertain by the careful and candid
examination of her own documents whether there is, or is not, any
authority for the assertion that she teaches what is commonly
called &lsquo;The Doctrine of the Real Presence.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
doing this, our first business is to ascertain what is the real
point at issue, and this is not so easy a task as it may appear,
as <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>amongst
those who maintain that doctrine there are no authoritative
documents on the subject to which we can refer.&nbsp; But, I
believe, I am perfectly safe in arranging the three principal
points at issue under the three heads of the Real Presence,
Adoration, and Sacrifice; and these three I propose to
investigate in that order.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE REAL PRESENCE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> lies at the foundation of the
whole controversy, and to this our first and chief attention must
be directed.&nbsp; Now, there can be no doubt on the minds of
those who take the Word of God as their true and only guide that
it is the sacred privilege of the Children of God to feed by
faith on the most precious body and blood of our blessed
Saviour.&nbsp; I am not now discussing in what way we feed on
Him, or whether His words in the 6th chapter of St. John refer,
or do not refer, to the Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&nbsp; It is my own belief that they do not; but that is
not the present question.&nbsp; My present concern is with the
fact that, however we explain His words, we are taught by our
Lord Himself that such a feeding is essential to our life:
&lsquo;Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His
blood, ye have <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>no life in you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nor can there be any doubt
that in 1 Cor. x. 16, 17, the partaking
(<i>&kappa;&omicron;&iota;&nu;&omega;&nu;&#943;&alpha;</i>) of
the body and blood of Christ is connected with the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&nbsp; I am not now making any assertion as to the way in
which it is connected, for that is the great point to be
determined.&nbsp; All that I now say is that there clearly is a
connexion, for the words are: &lsquo;The cup of blessing which we
bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?&nbsp; The
bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of
Christ?&nbsp; For we being many, are one bread and one body; for
we are all partakers of that one bread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two things, therefore, seem plain from Scripture: that there
is a feeding on the body and blood of our most blessed Saviour,
without which none can live, and that the Sacrament of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper is in some way or other connected with that
sacred privilege.&nbsp; Thus far, I presume, we are all
agreed.&nbsp; But as to the nature of the connexion, there is the
widest possible divergence.&nbsp; Rome teaches that by the act of
consecration the bread and wine become Christ Himself; that the
bread and wine cease to be bread and wine, and that both the
bread <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and
wine become each of them a whole Christ, body, soul, and
divinity.&nbsp; The advocates for the doctrine of the Real
Presence in the Church of England differ, as far as I can
understand them, from Rome in one respect, and one only; namely,
that they maintain that the bread and wine do not cease to have
the accidents of bread and wine, so that they may still be spoken
of as bread and wine, although they have become the body and
blood of Christ, or rather Christ Himself.&nbsp; This slight
difference is of no practical importance in the discussion, and
appears to have been introduced only to avoid the conclusion
drawn from those texts which speak of the bread as bread, and the
wine as wine, after consecration.&nbsp; The practical conclusion
is the same, viz. that our Lord Jesus Christ Himself is in the
bread and in the wine.&nbsp; This is what is meant by the
expression, &lsquo;The real objective presence.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
means that He is present in the elements as a real independent
object, without any reference to the character of the recipient,
as a book is an independent object in the hand of the man who
holds it, without any reference to his state of mind or
character.&nbsp; In opposition to this, it is maintained by us
who cling to the <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>great principles of the Reformation, that there is no
change whatever in the bread and wine, that they are solemnly set
apart for sacramental use by means of consecration, but that they
remain exactly the same as before consecration, in substance, and
accidents, and everything else.&nbsp; That the most precious body
and blood of Christ is altogether spiritual food, and that the
soul feeds on it by faith, and faith alone.&nbsp; That there are
two perfectly distinct kinds of food, the one material, and the
other spiritual; the one for the body, the other for the soul;
and two perfectly distinct actions; the one of the body eating
the bread, the other of the soul feeding on Christ Himself by
faith.&nbsp; That the material food is an emblem of the
spiritual; and that the act of eating by the body is an emblem of
the act of feeding by the soul; and the manner of the two are so
far connected by sacramental appointment, that when we receive
the emblem we are warranted to expect the enjoyment of the
reality.&nbsp; When the body feeds materially on the one, the
believer&rsquo;s heart feeds spiritually on the other; but the
two acts are distinct, and the one must not be confounded with
the other.&nbsp; From this statement <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>it will appear that the point at
issue is, whether the precious body and blood of our blessed Lord
and Saviour are in the bread and in the wine, so as to be eaten
and drunk whenever, and by whomsoever, the elements are received,
or whether the spiritual food described in this expression is
received by the soul alone without being localised in the
consecrated elements.&nbsp; And my object is to endeavour to
ascertain which of these two systems is taught by the Church of
England.&nbsp; That dear old Church is at this present time in a
position to call forth the deepest anxiety and the most earnest
prayers of all those who love the truth.&nbsp; Some are
endeavouring to destroy it, some to corrupt it, and some to
uphold it in its integrity.&nbsp; In such a state of things it is
not fair that the Church should be held responsible for the
assertions even of its friends.&nbsp; Its own voice ought to be
heard, and its own clear statement carefully studied.&nbsp; I
have no intention, therefore, of endeavouring to confuse the
subject by a mass of quotations from collateral writers, but will
turn at once to those authoritative documents for which the
Church has made herself responsible.&nbsp; These are the
Articles, Catechism, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Liturgy, and Homilies; and these, if
it please God, we will examine in order.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>The Articles</i>.&mdash;There are seven Articles&mdash;xxv.
to xxxi.&mdash;bearing more or less upon the subject; and from
these we may gather the real teaching of our Church.&nbsp; The
first of them, the twenty-fifth, refers to sacraments in
general.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only
badges or tokens of Christian men&rsquo;s professions, but rather
they be certain sure witnesses and effectual signs of grace, and
God&rsquo;s good will towards us, by the which He doth work
invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen
and confirm our faith in Him.&rsquo;&nbsp; In other words, before
men they are badges of our profession, and before God they are
signs or witnesses by which God works invisibly in the
soul.&nbsp; In this definition there is no idea of any change in
the substance of the sign.&nbsp; The sign is not described as
being changed into the thing signified, but as being accompanied
by it, so that when the believer with the hand and lip visibly
receives the sign, it pleases God in His own great grace
invisibly to feed the soul and confirm the faith.&nbsp; The
visible sign and <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>the invisible gift are therefore kept quite
distinct.&nbsp; The one is mercifully granted in connexion with
the other, but never said to be incorporated with it, for the
sign would cease to be a sign if it were changed into the thing
signified.&nbsp; With this definition of a Sacrament, the 27th
Article&mdash;which describes that of baptism&mdash;exactly
agrees.&nbsp; It describes it not merely as a badge of a
Christian man&rsquo;s profession, but also declares that it is a
sign and means of grace.&nbsp; &lsquo;A sign of regeneration or
new birth;&rsquo; a &lsquo;means whereby as by an instrument,
they that receive baptism rightly (1) are grafted into the
Church; (2) the promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our
adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly
signed and sealed; (3) faith is confirmed, and grace increased by
virtue of prayer unto God.&rsquo;&nbsp; But no change is here
described as taking place in the water.&nbsp; It is nowhere said
to be changed into regeneration.&nbsp; The gifts described are
God&rsquo;s direct gifts to the soul, and are never said to be
infused into the element of water.&nbsp; The water is sanctified,
or set apart for sacramental use, but the consecration produces
no change in its quality or substance.&nbsp; The new birth is <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>not in the
water, but is the act of the Holy Spirit moving in the
soul.&nbsp; The minister on earth visibly administers the visible
sign to the body, and we trust that God in heaven invisibly
bestows the invisible gift on the soul.&nbsp; It is not my
business now to discuss the connexion between the visible sign
and the invisible gift.&nbsp; It is enough for my present purpose
to point out that the one is not changed into the other, but that
the water remains water, or, in other words, that the sign does
not cease to be a sign, as it would do if it were changed into
the thing signified.</p>
<p>Now it would be strange indeed if after having first given so
perfectly clear a general definition of the general nature of a
sacrament, and having so clearly defined baptism, in perfect
harmony with that general definition, our Church were afterwards
to teach a doctrine respecting the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,
altogether at variance with the general definition, and with her
own explanation of the other sacrament.&nbsp; The Church of
England includes both sacraments in one definition, and in that
definition she never alludes to any change in the sign or
elements.&nbsp; In the sacrament of baptism, no one, I believe,
would <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>for
a moment assert the existence of such a change, even if there
were no special Article on the subject.&nbsp; Our conclusion
therefore must be, that, according to the Church&rsquo;s
teaching, there is no change in the elements in the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&nbsp; As the water in baptism remains water still, so the
bread and wine of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper remain what they were
before, plain, simple bread and wine; dedicated, it is true, to
the Lord&rsquo;s service, but altogether unchanged by such
dedication.</p>
<p>But we are not left to depend altogether on such conclusions,
for there is a special Article on the subject, viz., the
twenty-eighth.&nbsp; In the first clause we find the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper described as both sacraments were described in the
twenty-fifth, and baptism in the twenty-seventh, as a sign and
means of grace.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Supper of the Lord is not only a
sign of the love which Christians ought to have among themselves
one to another; but rather is a sacrament of our redemption by
Christ&rsquo;s death, inasmuch that to such as rightly, worthily,
and with faith receive the same, the bread which we break is a
partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise the cup of blessing
is a partaking of the blood of Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; Having gone
thus far in harmony with their general definition, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>and having
quoted the words from 1 Cor. x., our Reformers were clearly
brought to the consideration of the very point under discussion,
viz., in what way does the soul of the believer partake in the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper of the body and blood of his blessed Lord and
Saviour?&nbsp; This question they boldly and clearly answer,
declaring in the first place, what is not, and in the second
place, what is, the truth respecting it.&nbsp; They first declare
that it is not by transubstantiation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of
bread and wine), in the Supper of the Lord cannot be proved by
Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture,
overthroweth the nature of a sacrament&rsquo; (because if the
sign is changed into the thing signified, it ceases to be a
sign), &lsquo;and hath given occasion to many
superstitions.&rsquo;&nbsp; It would be fruitless to endeavour to
trace the sophistry with which those who desire reconciliation of
the Church of England with Rome, have endeavoured to avoid the
clear statements of this pungent Article.&nbsp; But their
conclusion is one which is such an outrage on common sense that
it would be utterly ludicrous if it were not inexpressibly
melancholy, to see men who, we hope, are devout men, embracing <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>it.&nbsp; We
are now deliberately told that the Article was not directed
against the doctrine of transubstantiation at all, but against a
change for which the name of &lsquo;transaccidentation&rsquo; has
been recently adopted.&nbsp; Now I know we live in an age of
discovery, but it is difficult for any person of plain common
sense, to believe in such a discovery as this.&nbsp; No one who
knows anything of the history of the Reformation can be ignorant
of the intense eagerness with which the doctrine of
transubstantiation was discussed.&nbsp; In books, in sermons, in
public disputations, it was argued again and again, by all the
most learned theologians of the day.&nbsp; The speculations of
the schoolmen as well as the writings of the early fathers were
largely quoted.&nbsp; The very distinction now revived between
substance and accident was carefully discussed.&nbsp; And men
felt so deeply the wide difference between the teaching of Rome
and the teaching of Scripture that they could not yield even to
save their lives.&nbsp; The stake was before them as the certain
issue of their confession, and liberty and honour was the
promised reward if only they would yield.&nbsp; But they had that
deep conviction of the deadly error of the doctrine of
transubstantiation that <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>they counted it a privilege rather to
die than to deny the truth of God.&nbsp; And I put it to any man
of common sense and common honesty: is it possible to believe
that, after all, there was no real difference between Rome and
the Reformers?&nbsp; That Bonner and Gardiner, and Latimer,
Cranmer, and Ridley did, in fact, agree; that there might have
been a little confusion in some of their minds as to the
difference between substance and accident, so that they used the
word transubstantiation without knowing its real meaning, but
that in all essential points they were agreed, so that the fires
of Smithfield were lighted all by mistake, and men who were
burned agreed with them that burned them.&nbsp; Clever men and
learned men may put forth such a theory, but common sense revolts
against it; and all thinking men must agree that, if this be the
only theory on which it can be maintained, the doctrine of the
Real Objective Presence is not the doctrine of the Church.&nbsp;
Plain honest men will be ready to cry &lsquo;shame&rsquo; on
those who by theological sophistry are endeavouring to evade the
plain and incontestable evidence of the great facts of the
Reformation.&nbsp; The Reformers knew well enough what <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Rome meant by
&lsquo;transubstantiation,&rsquo; and the twenty-eighth Article
is decisive on the point that there is no such change in the
Supper of the Lord.</p>
<p>But the error having been denied, the next clause of the
Article is employed to assert the truth: &lsquo;The body of
Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper only after an
heavenly and spiritual manner; and the means whereby the body of
Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is most important to observe that word &lsquo;only,&rsquo; for
it is exclusive of all material feeding.&nbsp; If it were not
there it might have been possible to have argued that the Article
admits the idea of a material in addition to a spiritual
feeding&mdash;a feeding with the mouth as well as a feeding with
the heart.&nbsp; But the word &lsquo;only&rsquo; renders any such
theory impossible.&nbsp; There is &lsquo;only&rsquo; one manner
in which He is received, and that one manner is heavenly and
spiritual.&nbsp; With equal clearness it is declared that as
there is only one mode in which the body of our blessed Saviour
is received, and that heavenly and spiritual; so there is only
one mean whereby it is received and eaten, and that one mean is
faith.&nbsp; The Article does not speak of <i>a</i> means, as if
it was one of many but <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>of &lsquo;<i>the</i> means&rsquo; in
order to show that it stands quite alone, that it is only
spiritual food, and received only by faith.&nbsp; The lips
receive the bread, and the believing heart receives the spiritual
food of Christ Himself.&nbsp; The body feeds on the material
food, the soul on the spiritual.&nbsp; The means whereby the body
feeds is the same as in common eating, and the means on which the
soul feeds is faith.</p>
<p>This important distinction of the outward and inward action is
taught with equal clearness in Article xxix.:&mdash;&lsquo;Of the
wicked which eat not the body of Christ in the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&rsquo;&nbsp; It may seem strange at first sight that any
persons should be eager to maintain that the wicked receive so
sacred a gift as the body and blood of our blessed Saviour; but a
very slight reflection will show the reason, for on this question
hinges the whole controversy.&nbsp; If the bread and wine have
become the body and blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, or if after
consecration He is in them, then it must follow as a matter of
certain consequence that whoever eats them eats Him.&nbsp; But
if, on the other hand, He is not in the bread and wine at all,
but is received by the heart as the bread and wine are by the
body, <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>then
it follows that if the heart be not right with God, a person may
eat the bread, but never feed on the body and blood of our most
blessed Lord and Saviour.&nbsp; The whole question whether there
is any independent, localized presence of our blessed Redeemer in
the elements is involved in the decision whether the wicked in
receiving those elements do or do not receive Him.&nbsp; On this
point the language of the twenty-ninth Article is perfectly
clear:&mdash;&lsquo;The wicked and such as be void of a lively
faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their
teeth (as St. Augustine saith) the sacrament of the body and
blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ; but
rather to their condemnation do eat and drink the sign or
sacrament of so great a thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; In quoting this
Article I am not ignorant of the attempt that has been made to
represent it as teaching that, although the wicked do eat the
body of Christ they do not receive His life-giving
blessings.&nbsp; But the Article does not say one word of
blessings.&nbsp; It is headed with the words, &lsquo;Of the
wicked which eat not the body of Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; It
describes the bread as being a sign of the body, and it affirms
as clearly as language can <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>affirm that a wicked person may press
the sign with his teeth, but still be in no wise either
materially, spiritually, with the body or with the soul, a
partaker of Christ.&nbsp; According to this Article a person may
eat the bread without eating the body of Christ, and receive the
wine, but never drink the blood of Christ.&nbsp; If the bread and
wine had by consecration become the body and blood, this clearly
would be impossible, for the one being changed into the other,
the two would be inseparable, or rather, they would cease to be
two, they would be one.&nbsp; It is clear, therefore, that no
such change is taught here; and this conclusion is remarkably
confirmed by the Rubric at the close of the Service for the
Communion of the Sick, for there the same great principle is
maintained with equal clearness, only from a different point of
view, when it says, &lsquo;If a man . . . by just impediment do
not receive the Sacrament of Christ&rsquo;s body and blood, the
curate shall instruct him that if he do truly repent himself of
his sins, and steadfastly believe that Jesus Christ hath suffered
death upon the Cross for him, and shed His blood for his
redemption, earnestly remembering the benefits he hath thereby,
and giving Him <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>hearty thanks therefore, he doth eat and drink the body
and blood of our Saviour Christ, profitably to his soul&rsquo;s
health, although he doth not receive the Sacrament with his
mouth.&rsquo;&nbsp; I venture to say that nothing can be clearer
than the combined testimony of these two most important
documents.&nbsp; The Article says, &lsquo;That a bad man may
receive with his mouth the Sacrament of the body of Christ, but
not be partaker of Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Rubric says that a
believer may under certain circumstances eat and drink the body
and blood of our Saviour Christ, although he do not receive the
Sacrament with his mouth.&nbsp; And if this is not a sufficient
proof that according to the teaching of the Church of England,
the sign or Sacrament is not changed into the thing signified, I
can imagine no proof that can be given.&nbsp; If they are made
one by the act of consecration, neither one nor the other can be
received alone.</p>
<p>Summing up, then, the teaching of the Articles, we shall
arrive at five important conclusions: (1.) A Sacrament is a sign,
and a sign would cease to be a sign if it were changed into the
thing signified.&nbsp; (2.) In the Sacrament of baptism there is
no change in the water.&nbsp; (3.) The <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>doctrine of transubstantiation is
condemned as clearly as words can condemn it.&nbsp; (4.) The body
of Christ is said to be received only after a heavenly and
spiritual manner.&nbsp; (5.) The wicked are declared to be in no
wise partakers of the sacred body and blood of our blessed Lord,
though with the mouth they eat the sign.&nbsp; And yet,
notwithstanding all this, there are those who boldly affirm that
the doctrine of the real presence of our blessed Lord and Saviour
in the elements is the undoubted teaching of the Church of
England.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Catechism</i>.&mdash;But is not the doctrine taught in the
Catechism?&nbsp; And if we look carefully, shall we not find it
there?&nbsp; One writer is so confident that we shall, that he
boldly affirms that the Catechism is the final and authoritative
decision of the Church on the subject, and must supersede all
previous documents; as if five short questions and answers, drawn
up for the use of children, were to override the full, dogmatic,
and controversial decisions of the Articles.&nbsp; I am not
surprised at his wish to draw attention from the Articles, but I
am persuaded he will gain nothing by directing it to the
Catechism.&nbsp; <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>I have no doubt that the portion of the Catechism
relating to the Sacraments is simply an abbreviation, or
adaptation, of the Articles.&nbsp; The same arrangement is
adopted, and the same definitions occur, in both documents.&nbsp;
The first three questions refer to Article xxv., the next to
Article xxvii., the next to Article xxviii.&nbsp; The two
Sacraments are first included in one common definition.&nbsp; The
Sacrament of baptism is then discussed separately, and I presume
that no one would venture to affirm that either in the general
definition of a Sacrament, or in the particular definition of
baptism, the outward sign is ever said to be changed into, or
confounded with, the thing signified.&nbsp; In these two
definitions they are kept distinct, and if the Catechism teaches
any such change in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, it must make a marked
and most important distinction between the two Sacraments, and so
neutralize its own general definition, which is carefully drawn
to include them both.&nbsp; It would, indeed, be strange if there
were such an inconsistency in so short a passage.&nbsp; But,
thanks be to God, there is nothing of the kind, and the whole is
in perfect harmony both with itself and with the Articles.&nbsp;
It is difficult <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>to imagine a clearer and more marked distinction than
that expressed in the second and third questions, &lsquo;What is
the outward part, or sign, of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper?&rsquo; and
&lsquo;What is the inward part or thing signified?&rsquo;&nbsp;
The distinctness between the two parts is here more clearly
marked than even in the Articles, for in these two questions
there is not merely the distinction which we have in them between
the sign and the thing signified, but the one is described as
outward and the other inward.&nbsp; The one is a material thing,
which the recipient may take in his hand, and which is altogether
external to himself; the other is inward and invisible, something
within the soul, and only seen by the inner man.&nbsp; It is,
therefore, utterly contrary to the teaching of these two
questions to suppose that both parts of the Sacrament are
outward, and that the inward and spiritual grace has a localized,
outward presence external to the soul of the recipient.</p>
<p>But though the questions are thus distinct, can we say the
same of the answers?&nbsp; The third answer is often boldly
appealed to as deciding the question in favour of what is termed
the real presence, and as finally settling the <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>whole
controversy.&nbsp; But nothing is easier than to make bold
assertions of the kind, to persuade men to receive them without
the trouble of investigation.&nbsp; But such a system will not
satisfy those who desire to know the truth.&nbsp; Let us then
examine the answer carefully.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the inward
part or thing signified?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The body and blood
of Christ; which are verily and indeed taken, and received by the
faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&rsquo;&nbsp; Great stress is
sometimes laid on the words, &lsquo;Verily and indeed,&rsquo; as
if they meant something more than a spiritual feeding on
Christ.&nbsp; But there is nothing in them to convey any such
idea.&nbsp; All they teach is that there is a real, true gift,
really enjoyed and received by the devout communicant; and this
we all thankfully believe.&nbsp; The question between us is not
whether there is such a gift; but what is its character, and how
is it received.&nbsp; The reality of the gift does not prove that
it is material, external, or connected in any way with the
natural elements.&nbsp; To maintain this would be to deny the
reality of anything spiritual and internal.&nbsp; Nothing,
therefore, can be proved either way from the words, &lsquo;Verily
and indeed.&rsquo;&nbsp; They cannot be quoted in <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>opposition to
the question to which they are intended as an answer, or in
deciding that the inward part is outward.&nbsp; They do assert
that the gift of the Lord is no mere fiction or idea, but they do
not teach in any way whatever that the sacred gift is in the
elements, and external to the soul.</p>
<p>But we have not yet done with this important answer, for there
are two more most important points to be noticed in it.&nbsp; In
the first place it is clearly stated that it is &lsquo;Verily and
indeed taken, and received by the faithful.&rsquo;&nbsp; One
ingenious writer endeavours to make out that the word
&lsquo;faithful&rsquo; is here intended to include the
wicked.&nbsp; I suppose that we are bound to give him credit for
believing what he writes; but it is very difficult for those to
do so who read common English in the light of common sense.&nbsp;
And still more difficult is it when the Catechism is read in the
light of the twenty-eighth Article, from which it was in all
probability constructed, and which says, &lsquo;To such as
rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the bread
which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Can any reasonable man compare these passages, and doubt for a
moment that by the words &lsquo;the faithful,&rsquo; are <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>intended
those persons who &lsquo;approach in faith whereby alone they can
feed on Christ.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there is another point in that same answer which claims
our careful consideration.&nbsp; The words are, &lsquo;which are
received by the faithful in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It does not say, &lsquo;in the Sacrament,&rsquo; for if it did it
might have been misunderstood.&nbsp; In the use of the word
&lsquo;Sacrament&rsquo; there is a risk of confusion, for it is
employed in three different senses.&nbsp; It is sometimes
employed to denote the whole act, or sacramental service, as in
Article xxv., where Sacraments are described as badges,
witnesses, and signs.&nbsp; It is sometimes used to express the
outward sign and the inward gift, regarded as forming together
one perfect whole, as in the third question and answer of the
Catechism, by which we are taught that there are two parts in a
Sacrament&mdash;the outward visible sign, and the inward
spiritual grace.&nbsp; But sometimes it is used for the outward
sign alone, unaccompanied by the spiritual grace, as in Article
xxix., where we read that the wicked are in no wise partakers of
Christ, &lsquo;but rather to their condemnation do eat and drink
the sign, or Sacrament, of so great a thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
my conviction that this <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>looseness in the use of the word
&lsquo;Sacrament&rsquo; had led to great confusion; for when
those who hold the great doctrines of the Reformation have
declared their belief in the presence of their blessed Redeemer
in the Sacrament, they have used the word in the sense of the
sacred feast, and expressed their assurance that He, a living
Lord, is present in the midst of His waiting people.&nbsp; But
others, taking the word &lsquo;Sacrament&rsquo; to mean simply
the consecrated elements, may quote such words from the
staunchest reformers, as proving that even they taught the
presence of the Lord in the bread and wine.&nbsp; Happily, in the
Catechism this danger is avoided, for in this important answer
the word &lsquo;Sacrament&rsquo; is not used at all.&nbsp; The
sacred feast is there called the &lsquo;Lord&rsquo;s
Supper,&rsquo; respecting which there is no confusion, and the
result is that there is not even the misuse of a word to
encourage the idea of anything like a presence in the
elements.</p>
<p>But if there were any room for doubt as to the meaning of the
Church of England in this passage, it would surely be removed by
the next question and answer, &lsquo;What are the benefits
whereof we are partakers thereby?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;The <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>strengthening
and refreshing of our souls by the body and blood of Christ, as
our bodies are by the bread and wine.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
difficult to imagine language which could preserve the
distinction of the outward and the inward parts more clearly than
this does.&nbsp; The outward is for the body, and strengthens it;
the inward for the soul, and does the same for it.&nbsp; The one
food is material for a material body; the other is spiritual, for
the spiritual sustenance of the soul.&nbsp; The one is external,
to be received into the body by bodily organization; the other is
internal and invisible, received into the soul by faith.&nbsp; To
identify the two, or to shut up the one within the other, is to
violate the whole principle of the passage; it is to confuse
material and spiritual things, and utterly to depart from the
teaching of the Church of England by giving a material character
to the most spiritual act of which the soul is capable.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>The Communion Service</i>.&mdash;But there is yet another
most important document, and one inexpressibly precious to the
heart of every devout communicant amongst us: I mean the
Communion Service, or &lsquo;Order of Administration of <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, or Holy Communion.&rsquo;&nbsp; How often
have those sacred prayers expressed the deep feeling of our
inmost soul, as we have knelt in holy faith before the Table of
the Lord?&nbsp; Now there cannot be a moment&rsquo;s doubt that
we are taught in that most precious Service to feed on the body
and blood of our most blessed Saviour, and to expect that the
most sacred food will be given to the soul.&nbsp; If this were
not expressed, the bread which we break would not be presented to
us as a partaking of the body of Christ.&nbsp; But while we are
taught in living faith to partake of His most precious body and
blood, the whole service has been so carefully worded that the
spiritual grace is never identified with the outward sign.&nbsp;
As in the Articles and Catechism, the two things are kept
perfectly distinct.&nbsp; In simply reading the Service as we now
have it, this care is not always apparent, for the language of
devotion is never the language of controversial theology, and the
spirit of fervent prayer does not admit of the expression of
theological distinctions.&nbsp; Full hearts do not stop to define
when they are pleading before God.&nbsp; But the utmost care was
taken, and we profit from the results.&nbsp; This is <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>easily seen
by a comparison of the two Prayer Books of Edward VI.&nbsp; The
Reformation was a gradual process, so that the Prayer Book of
1549 is less distinct than that of 1552.&nbsp; In the latter book
there were important changes made, and these changes indicate
very plainly the real teaching of our present Prayer Book.&nbsp;
In the Prayer Book of 1549, there were some passages which might
have been understood as teaching that the most precious body and
blood of our Lord was to be received in the consecrated elements
of bread and wine; but in the book of 1552, these passages were
all changed so as to render such a sense impossible.</p>
<p>For example: in the exhortation to communicants, it was
written in the book of 1549, &lsquo;He hath left <i>in</i> these
holy mysteries, as a pledge of His love, and a continual
remembrance of the same, <i>his own blessed body and precious
blood</i> for us to feed upon spiritually to our endless comfort
and consolation.&rsquo;&nbsp; If the word &lsquo;mysteries&rsquo;
was understood of the consecrated elements, this passage might
have been understood as teaching that the spiritual food was
actually in the consecrated bread and wine.&nbsp; So in 1552, the
passage was changed to the well-known words, &lsquo;He hath <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>instituted
and ordained holy mysteries as pledges of His love, and continual
remembrance of His death, to our great and endless
comfort,&rsquo; and all possibility of misapprehension was
removed.</p>
<p>Again, in the prayer of consecration in 1549 we find the
words, &lsquo;Hear us, O Merciful Father, we beseech thee; and
with Thy Holy Spirit and Word vouchsafe to bless and sanctify
these Thy gifts and creatures of bread and wine, that they may be
unto us the body and blood of Thy most dearly beloved Son Jesus
Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; These words might fairly be taken as praying
for a change in the elements, and therefore in the next version
the passage was completely changed, and the unmistakable language
of our present Prayer Book introduced in its stead: &lsquo;Grant
that we receiving these Thy creatures of bread and wine,
according to Thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ&rsquo;s holy
institution, in remembrance of His death and passion, may be
partakers of His most blessed body and blood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So in the prayer before consecration.&nbsp; In the first book
the words were, &lsquo;Grant us, therefore, gracious Lord, so to
eat the flesh of Thy dear Son Jesus Christ, and to drink His
blood <i>in these Holy Mysteries</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; But this was
liable to the same <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>danger as the passage in the exhortation already
referred to, and therefore the words, &lsquo;In these holy
mysteries,&rsquo; were struck out, and the prayer left as it now
stands in our Prayer Book.</p>
<p>And so once more, in the words of administration in the first
book there was only the first portion of the present
sentences.&nbsp; The words were: &lsquo;The body of our Lord
Jesus Christ, which was given for thee, preserve thy body and
soul unto everlasting life.&rsquo;&nbsp; But though not
necessary, it was possible to understand this as if the bread
presented to the communicants were declared to be the body of our
Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; To prevent this, the following words,
&lsquo;Take and eat this, and feed on <i>Him in thy heart by
faith</i>, with thanksgiving,&rsquo; were substituted in 1552,
and combined with the original form in 1559.&nbsp; Nothing can be
clearer, or more important, than the teaching of this
passage.&nbsp; In it the distinction is perfectly clear between
the bread which we eat, and the blessed Saviour on whom we
feed.&nbsp; Of the bread it says, &lsquo;Eat this,&rsquo; this
bread which I put into your hand.&nbsp; But of the inward and
spiritual grace it says, &lsquo;Feed on Him,&rsquo; on the Lord
Jesus Christ Himself; and this feeding is described as the act of
the <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>heart
through faith, for the words are, &lsquo;Feed on
<i>Him</i>&mdash;in thine heart&mdash;through faith&mdash;with
thanksgiving.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><i>Homilies</i>.&mdash;But there is another rich mine of truth
from which those who are anxious to learn the mind of the Church
of England may obtain most abundant information.&nbsp; I observe
that as a general rule those who teach the doctrine of the real
presence in the elements refer very little to the Homilies.&nbsp;
They treat them as if they were not aware of their existence, and
I am not surprised at their silence, for they certainly can find
nothing in them to support their system.&nbsp; You may search the
Homilies from one end to the other, and you will find nothing
there to support the doctrine of a real presence of our Lord and
Saviour in the consecrated elements.&nbsp; They are in perfect
harmony with the Articles.&nbsp; The definition of a Sacrament is
the same, and preserves with equal clearness the distinction
between the outward sign and inward grace&mdash;as <i>e.g.</i>,
in the ninth Homily of the second book, where we read the
following reference to the words of Augustine &lsquo;He calleth
Sacraments holy signs, and . . . saith <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>&ldquo;if Sacraments have not a
certain similitude of these things whereof they be Sacraments,
they should be no Sacraments at all.&nbsp; And of this
similitude, they do for the most part receive the names of the
same things they signify.&rdquo;&nbsp; By these words of St.
Augustine, it appeareth that he allowed the common description of
a Sacrament, which is that it is a visible sign of an invisible
grace, that is to say, that setteth out to the eyes, and other
outward senses, the inward working of God&rsquo;s free mercy, and
doth as it were seal in our hearts the promises of
God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But I must be careful with reference to the Homilies, for
there are two passages which are sometimes quoted in order to
show that the doctrine of the real presence in the elements is
the doctrine taught in them.&nbsp; One of these passages is
quoted by Dr. Pusey in his book on the Real Presence, viz., the
Advertisement at the end of the First Book of Homilies:
&lsquo;Hereafter shall follow sermons of fasting, praying,
almsdeeds, &amp;c, of the nativity, passion, resurrection, and
ascension of our Saviour Christ; of the due receiving of His
blessed body and blood under the form of bread and wine,&rsquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>Now I am quite prepared to admit that when this
Advertisement was written, the writer of it did believe that the
body and blood of our blessed Lord was present under the form of
bread and wine; but even the Advertisement was no part of any
Homily, and can never be regarded as having been at any time a
portion of the authoritative teaching of the Church of
England.&nbsp; I am willing, however, to admit that, although not
authoritative, it may be regarded as indicating what was the
opinion of the writers at the date of the First Book of
Homilies.&nbsp; All, therefore, turns upon the date, and when I
remember that the First Book of Homilies was published in 1547,
two years before the first revision of the Communion Service,
viz., that in 1549, and five years before the second,
<i>viz.</i>, that in 1552, when the alterations to which I have
referred were made in the Communion Service; when, moreover, I
find that when the promised Homily was published, it was headed
by a different title, viz., &lsquo;The worthy receiving, and
reverend esteeming; of the Sacrament of the body and blood of
Christ;&rsquo; when, moreover, I find on its first page the
passage just quoted respecting the sign and thing signified, I am
<a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>altogether
at a loss to understand how a person of the learning of Dr. Pusey
should have quoted the Advertisement, as if it were the teaching
of the Church of England in her Homilies.&nbsp; He must have
known the date, and must have been perfectly acquainted with the
changes which took place five years after it.</p>
<p>But there is another passage sometimes quoted from the Homily,
and quoted with great assurance by those who desire to represent
the Church of England as teaching the doctrine of the real
presence.&nbsp; I once heard an advanced Ritualist preaching on
the subject, and with the utmost boldness he challenged us to
listen to the Homilies, and then he quoted the words, &lsquo;Thus
much we must be sure to hold, that in the supper of the Lord
there is no vain ceremony, no bare sign, no untrue figure of a
thing absent, but, as the Scripture saith, a marvellous
incorporation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh! how did my heart burn, as I sat
in that church, to cry aloud from my seat &lsquo;Read the whole
passage,&rsquo; but I was obliged to sit in silence, and
endure.&nbsp; Oh! how I pity laymen, who have no power of
contradiction, when they hear gross error preached to themselves
and their families!&nbsp; But I may read it <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>now:
&lsquo;The table of the Lord, the bread and cup of the Lord, the
memory of Christ, the annunciation of His death, yea, the
communion of the body and blood of the Lord&rsquo; (why was all
that left out?), &lsquo;In a marvellous
incorporation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now what is the meaning of this
marvellous incorporation?&nbsp; Does it mean the incorporation of
our blessed Lord and Saviour in the bread?&nbsp; Or does it refer
to the work of the Holy Ghost in the soul?&nbsp; Let the question
be decided by the words which conclude the sentence: &lsquo;In a
marvellous incorporation, which, by the operation of the Holy
Ghost&mdash;the very bond of our conjunction with Christ&mdash;is
through faith wrought in the souls of the faithful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But that is not all.&nbsp; The Homilies were written by men
deeply impressed by the truth of God: by men who loved the
Gospel, and who earnestly desired to see others partakers of
their joy.&nbsp; So they did not merely speak in the language of
accurate theology, but they appealed to souls with the fervour of
loving hearts.&nbsp; Let us listen, in conclusion, to the glowing
words with which they wind up the first part of their address,
&lsquo;It is well known that the meat we seek for in this supper
is spiritual food; the <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>nourishment of our soul; a heavenly
refection and not an earthly; an invisible meal and not bodily; a
ghostly substance and not carnal; so that to think that without
faith we may enjoy the eating and drinking thereof, or that that
is the fruition of it, is but to dream a gross carnal feeding,
basely objecting and binding ourselves to the elements and
creatures.&rsquo; . . . &lsquo;That when thou goest up to the
reverend Communion to be satisfied with spiritual meats, thou
look up with faith upon the holy body of thy God, thou marvel
with reverence, thou touch it with the mind, thou receive it with
the hand of thy heart, and thou take it fully with thy inward
man.&nbsp; Thus we see, beloved, that resorting to this table, we
must pluck up all the roots of infidelity, all distrust in
God&rsquo;s promises, that we make ourselves living members of
Christ&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; For the unbelievers and faithless
cannot feed upon that precious body.&nbsp; Whereas the faithful
have their life, their abiding in Him, their union, and, as it
were, their incorporation with Him.&nbsp; Wherefore let us prove,
and try ourselves unfeignedly without flattering ourselves,
whether we be plants of that fruitful olive, living branches of
the true vine, members indeed of Christ&rsquo;s mystical body, <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>whether God
hath purified our hearts by faith, to the sincere acknowledging
of His Gospel, and embracing of His mercies in Christ Jesus, so
that at this, His table, we receive, not only the outward
Sacrament, but the spiritual thing also; not the figure, but the
truth; not the shadow only, but the body; not to death, but to
life; not to destruction, but to salvation; which God grant us to
do through the merits of our Lord and Saviour: to whom be all
honour and glory for ever.&nbsp; Amen.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ADORATION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> far I have examined into the
teaching of the Church of England with reference to nothing but
the bare doctrine of transubstantiation, or, as it is now more
frequently called, of the real objective presence of the body and
blood of our blessed Saviour in the consecrated elements of bread
and wine.&nbsp; I have not discussed the question whether the
elements of bread and wine remain either in their substance or
their accidents, for these questions are not discussed by the
Church of England.&nbsp; The point maintained by the Church is
that the most precious body and blood of Christ are not in the
bread and wine at all, but are given by the direct action of the
Holy Ghost to the soul of the believer, and received by him
through faith.&nbsp; But we cannot leave the subject there, for,
as we are taught in the twenty-eighth Article, that doctrine <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>&lsquo;has
given occasion to many superstitions,&rsquo; and to two of these,
adoration and sacrifice, we must, if we would gather the real
teaching of the Church of England, direct our careful study.</p>
<p><i>Adoration</i>.&mdash;When we speak of adoration, let it not
be for one moment supposed that we refer to the adoration of the
Lord Jesus, as now seated at the right hand of God, for with the
whole heart, and the most profound reverence, we would fall at
His feet, and say, in the language of our Communion Service,
&lsquo;Thou only art Holy, Thou only art the Lord; Thou only, O
Christ, art most high in the glory of God the
Father.&rsquo;&nbsp; The adoration against which we protest is
the adoration of the Lord Jesus Christ as supposed to be
localised in the consecrated elements of bread and wine.&nbsp;
Such adoration must, of course, involve the belief that He, as a
living Lord, is actually present in each piece of consecrated
bread, and also in the consecrated wine, and for such a belief
there is not one word in Scripture.&nbsp; The doctrines of
transubstantiation and consubstantiation are made to rest on what
is called the literal interpretation of the words, &lsquo;This is
My body,&rsquo; &lsquo;This is My blood;&rsquo; but the <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>utter
inconsistency of the whole system is shown by the fact that while
its advocates maintain that these words must be taken literally,
and that their doctrine of the real presence is the necessary
consequence, they themselves completely depart from their own
principle of literal interpretation, and make a bold assertion
which the words, taken literally, distinctly contradict.&nbsp;
The words taken literally could certainly teach nothing more than
that the bread becomes the body, and the wine the blood of our
blessed Redeemer; but Rome teaches, and as far as I can learn the
modern Ritualists teach the same, that not only do the bread and
wine each separately become the body and blood, but that each of
them becomes by the act of consecration a complete living
Saviour, with Body, Soul, and Divinity; so that there is a living
Saviour in each piece of consecrated bread, and a living Saviour
in the cup, and that these living Saviours are to be adored or
worshipped with the same worship as is given to our blessed
Redeemer at the right hand of the throne in Heaven.&nbsp; I could
give scores of passages in proof of my statement; but the
well-known words of Mr. Bennett are sufficient: &lsquo;I am one
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>of those
who have lighted candles at the altar in the day-time, who use
incense at the holy sacrifice&mdash;who use the Eucharistic
vestments&mdash;who elevate the blessed Sacrament&mdash;who
myself adore, and teach the people to adore, the consecrated
elements, believing Christ to be in them&mdash;believing that
under their veil is the sacred body and blood of my Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such is the fabric raised on
what is called the literal interpretation of the words of our
blessed Saviour, a fabric for which those words taken literally
give no foundation of any kind whatever.&nbsp; But how is it with
the Church of England?&nbsp; Are men true Churchmen when they
elevate the elements for worship?&nbsp; Are they teaching the
doctrines of the Church of England when they teach that we are to
worship the living Lord in the bread and in the cup which the
priest raises above his head for adoration?&nbsp; It certainly
does not seem as if they were, for as far as I have been able to
discover, not one word from all our Church&rsquo;s documents is
ever quoted in support of the practice.&nbsp; The only position
taken up is that it is not expressly forbidden, and this position
I believe to be, like the rest of the system, without <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>foundation.&nbsp; It is quite true that comparatively
little is said, for the doctrine of transubstantiation being
denied and disproved, all the rest follows as a matter of
course.&nbsp; If there is no real objective presence there can be
no adoration.&nbsp; If a living Saviour be not in the elements He
cannot therein be adored.&nbsp; The whole controversy turns on
the doctrine of the Real Presence as the key-stone of the
system.&nbsp; But though the subject has not been so fully
discussed in our Church documents, there is quite enough to show
very clearly the mind of the Church of England.&nbsp; The
concluding words of Article xxviii. are quite enough to settle
the question: &lsquo;The Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper was
not by Christ&rsquo;s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted
up, or worshipped.&rsquo;&nbsp; How, with that Article before
them, clergymen of the Church of England can presume to elevate
the sacramental elements for worship I am at a loss to
explain.&nbsp; But this is not all that has been said, for the
practice of kneeling at the Lord&rsquo;s Supper occasioned at one
time a certain amount of anxiety in the minds of some persons, as
they feared that it might be mistaken for adoration of the
host.&nbsp; To prevent the possibility of any <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>such mistake
a most important note was added in the year 1552, which, after
having been omitted in 1559, was restored with a slight
alteration in 1662.&nbsp; It is as follows: &lsquo;It is hereby
declared, that thereby no adoration is intended, or ought to be
done, either unto the sacramental bread or wine there bodily
received, or unto any corporal presence of Christ&rsquo;s natural
flesh and blood.&nbsp; The sacramental bread and wine remain
still in their very natural substances, and, therefore, may not
be adored (for that were idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful
Christians); and the natural body and blood of our Saviour Christ
are in Heaven, and not here; it being against the truth of
Christ&rsquo;s natural body to be at one time in more places than
one.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such words as those need no comment, and I
should be only wasting time if I were to stop to discuss
them.&nbsp; Of course people endeavour to evade them; but the
attempts at evasion only tend to show the utter helplessness of
the undertaking.&nbsp; The memorialists already referred to, say,
&lsquo;We repudiate all adoration of a corporal presence of
Christ&rsquo;s natural flesh and blood, that is to say, of the
presence of His body and blood as they are in
Heaven.&rsquo;&nbsp; They admit it, therefore, in <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>some other
way.&nbsp; But the Church of England denies it altogether.&nbsp;
It draws no nice distinction as to the mode, but simply denies
the fact, and settles the question once and for ever for all
honest men whose honest desire it is to teach its doctrines and
adopt its worship.</p>
<p>But as we really desire to ascertain the truth, it is well to
refer to the statements of those who differ from us.&nbsp; I
turn, therefore, to those of Dr. Pusey, as I believe he is the
person who above all others would be regarded as the best
exponent of the theory of the Real Presence and its
consequences.&nbsp; In his book, <i>The Real Presence</i>, p.
311, he says: &lsquo;The Church of England has maintained the
same reserve as to the practice of adoring our Lord present in
the Eucharist.&rsquo;&nbsp; And again: &lsquo;With regard to the
adoration we are rather told that the Sacraments were not
ordained of Christ to be adored, but to be received.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I could not wish for a plainer statement of truth than those last
words, but I confess myself at a loss to understand how the
writer can teach adoration, and yet continue in his position as a
clergyman of the Church of England.&nbsp; But with the former
words I cannot agree, for the Church of England has not exercised
<a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>reserve.&nbsp; To exercise reserve is to keep in the
background a truth which we believe, but which from motives of
expediency we think it better not to make known.&nbsp; But there
is no such reserve in the Church of England.&nbsp; She is plain,
honest, and outspoken for the truth; and when she struck all
trace of adoration from her worship she did so, not from any
crafty policy of reserve, but because she believed that the whole
thing was a gross superstition, and with a firm, bold, and
unsparing hand she cut away the whole fabric, and left no trace
of it in the whole system of her worship.&nbsp; There was no
reserve in the Reformers, whatever there may be in those who are
striving to undo the Reformation.</p>
<h2><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SACRIFICE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> adoration is not all, for there
is yet a further result of the doctrine of the real objective
presence, if possible, more dangerous even than adoration; I mean
the assertion of a continued sacrifice.&nbsp; It is extremely
difficult to ascertain exactly what is held by the Ritualistic
party, for there is no document to which they all subscribe or
for which they can be held responsible; but there is quite enough
to show that a great number amongst them are teaching without
reserve that there is in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper a continuation,
or repetition, of the propitiatory sacrifice of our blessed
Lord.&nbsp; The extent to which this is carried may be gathered
from a book called the <i>Eucharist Manual</i>, to which
Archbishop Longley drew the attention of the Church in the year
1867, in which it is said that &lsquo;a real, true, and
substantial sacrifice is offered to God the Father, and not
merely a spiritual or <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>metaphorical sacrifice;&rsquo; that
the Holy Eucharist is &lsquo;a true, real, and substantial
sacrifice offered to God the Father, offered for the quick and
the dead;&rsquo; the meaning of which statement is proved beyond
the possibility of a doubt by the following prayers:
&lsquo;Eternal Father, I offer thee the precious blood of Jesus
Christ, in expiation of my sins, and for the wants of the whole
Church;&rsquo; and &lsquo;I now join Thy minister in offering
Thee this oblation of the body and blood of Thy Son, in
propitiation for my numberless sins, and for the salvation of all
bound to me by kindred or affection.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nothing would
be easier than to bring together almost any number of similar
passages, and I feel persuaded that I am not misrepresenting the
principles of the writers when I say that they teach the
continuation or repetition of the sacrifice of our blessed Lord
Himself as a propitiation for sin.&nbsp; Now is this the teaching
of the Church of England, or is it not?&nbsp; Dr. Pusey&rsquo;s
own language may, I think, decide the question.&nbsp; In his
book, on the <i>Real Presence</i>, p. 311, he says of the
Church&rsquo;s documents: &lsquo;Although the great act of
Eucharistic Sacrifice remains in the consecration itself, and it
has been all along an object of belief in the Church <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of England,
it is mentioned only when we pray to God to accept this our
sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving.&rsquo;&nbsp; This then is
the only passage in all the documents of the Church of England
which we may presume can be produced as being in favour of this
teaching, and I venture to say that Dr. Pusey is far too good a
theologian not to know that the passage is dead against the
doctrine of propitiatory sacrifice.&nbsp; Is it possible to
suppose that such a learned man as he is does not know the
distinction between a sacrifice of expiation and a sacrifice of
praise and thanksgiving, between an atonement for sin and the
free-will offering of a thankful and loving heart?&nbsp; And is
it possible that there should be one moment&rsquo;s doubt as to
the teaching of the Church of England, when the words, which he
himself acknowledges, are the only words which he can discover in
support of the one are words which beyond all controversy refer
exclusively to the other?</p>
<p>But is the Church of England as silent as he appears to
consider it on this important subject?&nbsp; Are we left to
gather its great principles from that one passage in the
Communion Service?&nbsp; Does it teach nothing on the subject of
propitiatory <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>sacrifice but in that one short sentence which has in
fact no connexion with it?&nbsp; The whole of the Church of God
depends on a completed propitiation, and we might well tremble
for the Church of England if that one great central fact were
altogether out of sight in its teaching.&nbsp; But, thanks be to
God! it is not thus ignored, for this is just one of those points
for which our Reformers were called to suffer, and respecting
which they were most explicit.</p>
<p>To begin with the Articles.&nbsp; The thirty-first consists of
three parts.&nbsp; (1.) The perfect sufficiency of the great
propitiation for sin.&nbsp; &lsquo;The offering of Christ
<i>once</i> made&rsquo; (observe the <i>once</i>) &lsquo;is that
perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the
sins of the whole world, both original and actual.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(2.) The declaration that in consequence of that sufficiency
there can be no further propitiation.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is none
other satisfaction for sin, but that alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; (3.) The
condemnation of the pretended sacrifice of the mass.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wherefore the sacrifice of masses, in the which it was
commonly said that the priest did offer Christ for the quick and
dead, to have remission of past guilt, were blasphemous fables
and dangerous deceits.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am not ignorant <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>that an
attempt has been made to represent this Article as referring to
the abuses which had gathered around the sacrifice of the mass,
and not against the principle of sacrifice itself.&nbsp; As I
should be extremely sorry to misrepresent the opinions of those
who differ from me, I quote Dr. Pusey&rsquo;s words as I find
them in his <i>Eirenicon</i>, p. 25: &lsquo;The very strength of
the expressions used, of &ldquo;the sacrifices of masses,&rdquo;
that they were blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits, the use
of the plural, and the clause &ldquo;in which it was commonly
said,&rdquo; show that what the Article speaks of is not the
sacrifice of the mass, but the habit (which, as one hears from
time to time, still remains) of trusting to the purchase of
masses when dying, to the neglect of a holy life, or repentance,
and the grace of God and His mercy in Christ Jesus while in
health.&rsquo;&nbsp; To what desperate shifts are persons driven
who would endeavour to represent the Church of England as
teaching the sacrifice of the mass!&nbsp; The Article declares
the sufficiency and finality of the one sacrifice of our blessed
Lord and Saviour, and because that one sacrifice is sufficient
and final, it condemns in the strongest possible language the
opinion current at the <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>time, that in some form or other
there was a repetition of sacrifice in the mass.&nbsp; But
because the language is strong, because there is an allusion to
the current opinion, and because the plural number is employed so
as to comprehend the numberless sacrifices supposed to be offered
on the numberless altars of the Church of Rome, therefore it is
argued that the Article does not refer to the doctrine of
sacrifice at all, but simply to the purchase of the mass in the
dying hour, instead of repentance and faith during the
life.&nbsp; If the Article were meant to condemn the purchase of
masses, it is very strange that it makes no allusion to the
subject; and if it aimed at the neglect of repentance and faith,
it is most extraordinary that neither repentance nor faith is
once mentioned in its words.&nbsp; Our Reformers were very
plain-spoken men, and it appears from the strength of their
language that they meant to be plain-spoken in the Article.&nbsp;
It is very strange if, after all, while they appeared to condemn
one thing, they were really condemning another, and did it in
such unintelligible language that their meaning was not
discovered till three hundred years after the Article was
written.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>In the
Catechism there is not much said on the subject, but that little
is decisive.&nbsp; There is only one allusion to sacrifice, and
that is, to the one sacrifice of our blessed Saviour, while the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper is distinctly declared to be an act of
remembrance of that great event.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Q.</i>&nbsp; Why
was the Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper
ordained?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>A.</i>&nbsp; For the continual
remembrance of the sacrifice of the death of Christ, and of the
benefits which we receive thereby.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is needless to
stop to point out that remembrance cannot mean either
continuation, repetition, or application; and with such a
distinct passage before us, it is manifest that no one can claim
the Catechism as teaching the doctrine of propitiatory sacrifice
in the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.&nbsp; There is an opinion in some
minds that the language of the Catechism is less distinctly
Protestant than that of the other documents.&nbsp; That opinion I
believe to be thoroughly mistaken, and it certainly is very
difficult to understand by what perversion of language the
doctrine of propitiatory sacrifice can be wrung from such
language as &lsquo;The continual remembrance of the sacrifice of
the death of Christ,&rsquo; and a &lsquo;thankful remembrance of
His death,&rsquo; as we <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>find in the answer with which the
Catechism concludes.</p>
<p>From the Catechism let us turn to the Communion Service.&nbsp;
And here we are met at the outset by Dr. Pusey&rsquo;s remarkable
admission, that the only passage teaching the doctrine is the
language of thankful dedication in the prayer that follows the
reception: &lsquo;We, Thy humble servants, entirely desire Thy
Fatherly goodness mercifully to accept this our sacrifice of
praise and thanksgiving.&rsquo;&nbsp; No person who understands
the difference between propitiation and thanksgiving can fail to
see at a glance that there is no reference in this passage to
propitiatory sacrifice.&nbsp; The next sentence is: &lsquo;Here
we offer and present unto Thee, O Lord, ourselves, our souls and
bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and lively sacrifice unto
Thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ourselves, our souls and bodies,&rsquo;
what are they to make a propitiation for sin?&nbsp; Nothing can
be plainer than that the prayer is intended to be the language of
the thankful heart surrendering itself as a thank-offering to
God.&nbsp; If the language admitted of the smallest doubt, that
doubt would be removed by the position assigned to it in the
Communion Service of 1552.&nbsp; <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>In that of 1549 it stood with certain
additions before the administration of the sacramental elements,
but the human mind is so prone to misunderstand the simplest
documents, that our Reformers, to avoid all possibility of
mistake, first removed from the prayer any expressions which they
thought could be misunderstood, and then placed it after, instead
of before, the reception of the elements.&nbsp; Thus they secured
that there should be no room for doubt that the sacrifice
referred to is the surrender of self, and the motive for that
surrender, not the desire for forgiveness, but the deep gratitude
of a thankful heart, when sin has been blotted out through a
finished atonement, and the appropriation of that atonement has
been sealed to the soul by the sacred emblems of His body and
blood.</p>
<p>But these were not the only changes made in the Communion
Service of 1552.&nbsp; There was another of a most important
character in connexion with the subject of sacrifice.&nbsp; You
never hear of sacrifice without an altar.&nbsp; The altar is, in
fact, an essential adjunct of sacrifice, and accordingly in
former times there was an altar, generally made of stone, against
the eastern <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>wall of the chancel.&nbsp; Accordingly in the Communion
Service of 1549, there is frequent mention of the altar; but in
1552 all altars were abolished.&nbsp; There is no allusion to an
altar now in any document of the Church of England.&nbsp; When
persons speak of leading brides to the altar, they are not using
the language of the Church, nor are they presenting the holy rite
of marriage in a very happy aspect, for the expression really
implies that the poor bride is led to sacrifice.&nbsp; There is
now nothing but a table known in the Church of England.&nbsp; The
altar has been removed, and the table introduced, in order that
all might see even in the Church&rsquo;s furniture, that the
doctrine of sacrifice has been abandoned, and that the doctrine
of communion is the true creed of the Church of England.&nbsp; It
may be sufficient to refer to the fourth rubric as a specimen of
the changes made.&nbsp; In 1549 it was, &lsquo;The priest
standing humbly afore the midst of the altar shall say,&rsquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; In 1552, &lsquo;The table having at the Communion
time a fair white linen cloth upon it, shall stand in the body of
the church or in the chancel, where Morning Prayer and Evening
Prayer be appointed to be said.&nbsp; And the <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>priest
standing at the north side of the table shall say,&rsquo;
&amp;c.</p>
<p>And now for the Homilies, the last authority to which we have
to refer in this inquiry.&nbsp; I am not surprised that those who
maintain the doctrine of a continuation of propitiatory sacrifice
preserve a prudent silence with reference to the Homilies.&nbsp;
I do not know of any one passage ever quoted by them in support
of their opinions, while every allusion to the subject in the
Homilies is of a distinctly opposite character.&nbsp; Let us turn
to one or two passages from the 15th Homily of the Second
Book.&nbsp; In the first page of that Homily we have a general
description of the Sacred Feast.&nbsp; &lsquo;Amongst the which
means is the public celebration of the memory of His precious
death at the Lord&rsquo;s Table: which, although it seems of
small virtue to some, yet being rightly done by the faithful, it
doth not only keep their weakness, but strengtheneth and
comforteth their inward man with peace and gladness, and maketh
them thankful to their Redeemer with diligent care and godly
conversation.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here we have the description of the
same two purposes as are mentioned in the Articles and Catechism,
but not <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>one syllable respecting sacrifice, for no one who values
correctness in language can maintain that memory is continuation,
or that the memory of His precious death can be a renewed act of
propitiation.&nbsp; But this may be thought to be only an
omission.&nbsp; Let us pass on then to the following page, when
we read, &lsquo;For as that worthy man, St. Ambrose, saith:
&ldquo;He is unworthy of the Lord that otherwise doth celebrate
that mystery than it was delivered by Him.&nbsp; Neither can he
be devout that otherwise doth presume that it was otherwise given
by the Author.&rdquo;&nbsp; We must, therefore, take heed lest of
the memory it be made a sacrifice; lest of a Communion it may be
made a private eating; lest of two parts we have but one; lest in
applying it for the dead we lose the fruit that be
alive.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the Homily for Whit Sunday, the self-same
truth is taught, with almost equal clearness.&nbsp; When it is
said of the Church of Rome that they &lsquo;have so intermingled
their own traditions and inventions, by chopping and changing, by
adding and plucking away, that now they (the Sacraments) may seem
to be converted into a new guise.&nbsp; Christ commended to His
Church a Sacrament of His body and blood; they have changed it
into a <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>sacrifice for the quick and the dead.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
yet notwithstanding all these statements and many others, there
are those who hold office as clergymen of the Church of England,
who are not ashamed of circulating such a book as the
&lsquo;Eucharist Manual,&rsquo; in which it is said: &lsquo;The
Holy Eucharist is a true and substantial sacrifice offered to God
the Father, offered for the quick and dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, I may conclude.&nbsp; My object, let it be well
remembered, has not been to discuss the subject from the
Scriptures, but to ascertain the real teaching of the Church of
England respecting it.&nbsp; Let it not be supposed for one
moment that I have taken this position from any idea that there
is any infallible rule of faith but God&rsquo;s own Word as
revealed in Scripture; but I have done so because the Church of
England is at this present time sorely tried by internal
difficulties, and it seems only due to her to ascertain with the
utmost care what is the real character of her teaching.&nbsp;
While some are loudly claiming her as teaching those very
doctrines in opposition to which our Reformers went to the stake,
and while others of a tender conscience are forsaking her because
they partially believe those bold statements to be <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>true, it is
of the utmost possible importance that those who are faithful to
the Church of England should take the trouble to make themselves
acquainted with her true principles.&nbsp; If it is a fact that
she is identical with Rome, and that the Reformers were martyrs
for a merely imaginary metaphysical distinction of no importance
whatever; then, indeed, we may stand aghast at the ignorance and
folly of all the theologians of all schools and all countries who
have been weak enough to suppose that in the Reformation there
was a doctrinal separation from the Apostasy of Rome.&nbsp; But
if, on the other hand, the Reformers knew what they were doing,
and why they did it; if they drew up these documents with the
utmost care, and these documents so provoked the doctrinal
antipathies of Rome, that while their authors were sacrificed at
the stake their principles were branded by the anathemas of the
Council of Trent; if none of our most thoughtful students for the
last three centuries ever for one moment doubted that there was
direct antagonism between the Church of England and that of Rome;
then it is too sad to be borne that devout men, dearly beloved in
the Lord, staunch to the great principles of the Gospel of the
Grace of God, should <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>have their consciences wounded, and
their allegiance shaken, by the unproved assertions of men who,
without any appeal to the Church&rsquo;s documents, claim to be
the only expositors of its principles.&nbsp; It is moreover most
deeply to be deplored that those who have a real, true, and
faithful love for the Church of England should be led into error
by the unproved assertion that the Church of England teaches that
which she most emphatically denies.&nbsp; It is for the sake of
both classes that I have been led to this investigation.&nbsp; If
any are unsettled in their mind and disposed to distrust the
Church of England, I shall rejoice if they are led to see how
sound, how clear, and how perfectly Scriptural she is upon the
subject.&nbsp; And if any have been led by mistaken ideas of the
Church&rsquo;s teaching to hold opinions at variance with the
great principles of the Reformation, I shall thank God more than
I can express if they may be led to see what the Church which
they love really teaches, that so the love of their Church may
confirm them in the love of truth, and help to establish them as
steady and consistent Churchmen in the faith once delivered to
the saints.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
